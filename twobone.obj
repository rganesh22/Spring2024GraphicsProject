# Simple 2 Bone OBJ Example

# Vertices (Positions)
v 0.0 0.0 0.0  # Bone 1 Start (Root)
v 1.0 0.0 0.0  # Bone 1 End / Bone 2 Start
v 2.0 0.0 0.0  # Bone 2 End

# Joint/Bone Weights
# Assuming the first vertex (v 0.0 0.0 0.0) is fully influenced by bone 1,
# the second vertex (v 1.0 0.0 0.0) is influenced by both bones,
# and the third vertex (v 2.0 0.0 0.0) is fully influenced by bone 2.

# This section is optional and used in cases where you want to specify
# how vertices are influenced by bones.
# Each line corresponds to a vertex (starting from 1) and specifies
# the bone index and the weight (influence) of that bone.

# Bone influences: vertex index, bone index, weight
vw 1 1 1.0  # Vertex 1 fully influenced by bone 1
vw 2 1 0.5  # Vertex 2 influenced 50% by bone 1
vw 2 2 0.5  # Vertex 2 influenced 50% by bone 2
vw 3 2 1.0  # Vertex 3 fully influenced by bone 2

# Faces (Polygons)
# Defining a simple line connecting the vertices
l 1 2  # Line from Bone 1 Start to Bone 1 End
l 2 3  # Line from Bone 1 End to Bone 2 End

# Bone Definitions (for a simple hierarchy example)
# Bones typically would be defined in a separate skeleton file or section,
# but here we are just showing a basic structure.

# Bone 1
b 1 0.0 0.0 0.0  # Bone 1 root position
# Bone 2
b 2 1.0 0.0 0.0  # Bone 2 root position (same as Bone 1 end)

# The comments here indicate how bones would be conceptually added.
# However, OBJ format doesn't directly support bones,
# and they are usually part of a rigging system in formats like FBX or COLLADA.
